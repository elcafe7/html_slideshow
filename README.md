##Intro

html_slideshow is a basic HTML page that utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a simple website you can upload to your server, or even use offline to display a slideshow in the same folder as your HTML page with images successively names 1.png, 2.png etc. It includes a little navigation bar at the bottom.

This is intended as a low-tech, low bloat way to display a slideshow of images, whether it be a PowerPoint or just photos without the bloatware of office products or their FOSS imitations.

You can export existing slideshows from Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Drive or Apple for similar use in this program.

##Use

    Place this index.html in the same folder as your images (1.png, 2.png, etc.).
